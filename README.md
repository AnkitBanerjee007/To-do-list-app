# To-do-list-app
<p>This is a to-do list app where you can add , delete or mark as completed tasks </p> 
<p> This website is the first place where I practiced jQuery after a long journey with vanilla Javascript </p>
<h2> How to use it? </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Click on the 'plus' icon to get or hide the input box </li>
  <li> Type your goals in the input box </li>
  <li> Press 'Enter' on your laptop/pc or click 'Go' in your phone to add a new goal </li>
  <li> When your goal is achieved click on the goal to 'mark as completed' </li>
  <li> If you want to 'Delete' a goal just hover or click on it , and a 'minus' icon will appear , click on it to delete your goal </li>
